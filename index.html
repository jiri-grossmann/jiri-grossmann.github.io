		<h1>Jiří Grossmann</h1>
		<h2>Soon to be developer <span id="hidethis">hopefully</span></h2>
		<p>I'm a little bit of a perfectionist, either it's everything or im not satisfied with showing it. In my free time when I'm really hooked on some games I like to create fun little stuff to spice up the gameplay when game gets a little bit stale. Last time I made a fun little bot on discord to give me random perks for a game called Dead by Daylight. Code has since been lost due to harddrive failure sadly and I haven't gotten back to remaking the bot yet.</p>

			<h2 style="color: black">Instruction set</h2>
			<p>All computers run using very low-level commands which do some very basic functions, such as reading data, writing data, and address jumping, and basic arithmetic. (The complete list of commands that can be run by a CPU is known as that computer’s instruction set). Instruction sets are relatively small; most higher-order programming languages, such as C++, Ada, Fortran, or Visual Basic, must be compiled (or translated, or interpreted) into these low level commands in order for a program to run.</p>
